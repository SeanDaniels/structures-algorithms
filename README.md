# Structures and Algorithms
This workspace will be used to solidify and enhance my understanding of common data structures and sorting algorithms. Data structures are used throughout programming to efficiently store and manipulate data. A reasonable understanding of a wide breadth of structures and algorithms is necessary for writing efficient code.

The following topics will be covered:

- Searching
- Sorting
- Dynamic Programming

The following data structures will be examined:

- Trees
- Lists
- Queues
- Stacks
- Hash Tables
- Graphs
- Windows
