# Concept

Graph traversal is the method with which a graph is iterated through. There are two primary methods: Depth First Search (DFS) and Breadth First Search (BFS).

# DFS

DFS uses a stack to store the nodes that are being visited. Edges that lead to an unvisited node are called 'discovery edges'.

There are both iterative and recursive methods for performing a depth first search on graph. This description outlines a recursive approach.
