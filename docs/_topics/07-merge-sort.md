Merge sort is a comparison based sorting algorithm. 

| Merge Sort                  |   |
|:---------------------------:|:-:|
| Best-case performance       |   |
| Worst-case performance      |   |
| Average performance         |   |
| Worst-case space complexity |   |

# Algorithm

- Divided unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element
- Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until only one sublist remains
