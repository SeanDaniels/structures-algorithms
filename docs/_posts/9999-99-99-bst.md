# Binary Search
One method of searching through a data structure, such as an array, is iterate through each element of the structure until the desired element is found. This method is known as a linear search. 

In some scenarios, it is wasteful to visit every element of a data structure to locate a particular element. A binary search removes some of this overhead by halving it's search range until the element is located. A binary search requires the structure being searched is sorted.

# Binary Search Tree
![Binary Search Tree](/binary-search-tree/img/bst.jpg)


A binary search tree (BST) is a data structure consisting of a single 'root' node and any number of internal nodes. Each node contains a pointer to a left subtree and a pointer to right subtree. A BST follows the property that the key value of each node of the left subtree is less than the key value of the root node, and the key value of each node of the right subtree is greater than the key value of the root node. Because of this property, each comparison allows approximately half of the remaining tree to be skipped when searching for a key value.

A BST allows binary search for looking up, adding, and removing items

# Time Complexity in Big O Notation
| Algorithm | Average  | Worst Case |
|:----------|:---------|:-----------|
| Space     | O(n)     | O(n)       |
| Search    | O(log n) | O(n)       |
| Insert    | O(log n) | O(n)       |
| Delete    | O(log n) | O(n)       |


# Nodes
At the most basic level, a node is structure that contains a key value and a pointer to it's own left subtree and a pointer to it's own right subtree

# Searching
A BST can be searched iteratively or recursively

The pseudo code for searching a BST is as follows:

``` c++
// point to root of bst
Node* nodePtr = root;
// while nodeptr isn't null
while(nodePtr){
    // key found, return node ptr
    if(key==nodePtr->key)return nodePtr;
    // key greater, search right
    if(key>nodePtr->key)nodePtr=nodePtr->right;
    // key less, search left
    else nodePtr=nodePtr->left;
}
return nodePtr;
```
# Inserting
Inserting a new node into a BST is accomplished with the following routined:
- Create a new node
- Locate appropriate position for new node
- Point parent node to new node

The pseudo code for inserting a new node is as follows:
``` c++
// point to root of bst
Node* nodePtr = new Node(keyValue);
if(root==nullptr)root = nodePtr;
else{
    Node* tmp = root;
    while(tmp){
    if(tmp->key > keyValue){
        // if left node is available, place new node here
        // if not, search left
    }
    else 
    // if right node is available, place node here
    // if not, search right
    
    }
}
```
# Deleting
In order to successfully remove a node from the BST, the node must be deleted and any pointers referencing the node must be updated. 

While removing a node from a BST, the underlying structure of the BST must be retained. This may require updating the removed node's parents and children. This is summarized in the following 3 cases:
- The removed node has no children
- The removed node has either a left child or a right child (1 child)
- The removed node has both a left child and a right child (2 children)

# Hashing
At it's highest level, hashing is the act of associating some value into some other value. Hashing as a concept occurs in the realm of cryptography, with a heavy focus on developing secure and efficient functions for the association of data with a particular key. That topic is outside of the scope of this project. Here, I will focus on the basics of hashing in order to implement a table. 

An effective hashing function accomplishes meets the following parameters:
- Creates a reasonably unique key for each element
- Computes quickly

To be considered a perfect hash function, the function must generate a unique key for each element of the data set being hashed.

Let's examine a very basic hashing function. Let's say we have a known number of integer elements in a set of data. We could generate a key for each element by doing something like:

``` c++
int key = value % numberOfElements;
```
If the data set contained 15 elements, the following values would produce the following keys:

| Value | Key |
|:-----:|:---:|
| 10    | 5   |
| 16    | 1   |
| 12    | 3   |

Through the process of hashing, a value is associated with some key.


# Hash Table
Hashing is used as a building block for the hash table data structure. A hash table consists of elements indexed by their key. This has an advantage over a simple array in terms of search time. Since the location of the element within the structure is dependent on the element, searching does not need to be iterative or binary. In a perfect hash table, an element can be found in constant time. 

A hash table is built by allocating a fixed amount of contiguous memory, just like an array. When adding elements to the array, a hash function generates a key for the value, and the value is inserted into the allocated space at the index provided by the key. 

If it is known that the allocated memory is greater than the required memory for the elements and the hash function generates a unique key for every value in the set, no further action is needed. If either one of those conditions is not met, a collision policy must be establised. A collision is when the index, produced by the key, points to a location in memory that is occupied with data. There are two primary choices for handling collisions:
- Probing
- Chaining

Probing handles a collision by iterating through the indices of the allocated memory
